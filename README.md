# About me - IctCat
I love web development and technology in general. Currently I am interested to learn more about cyber security.
Obviously I work with Linux systems as well.

# Core values
- Open source comes first. Giving back to the community is important!
- Don't cause harm for others if it's not necessary for your self-defense.
- Linux for the win!


# Big things to be announced soon...
Currently I am working on my own private projects which I aim to open source at some point.
